# üìä MANUAL BINNING TECHNIQUES: EQUAL-WIDTH, EQUAL-FREQUENCY & ENTROPY-BASED

## üöÄ INTRODUCTION
WELCOME TO **MANUAL BINNING TECHNIQUES**, A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO IMPLEMENTING **EQUAL-WIDTH BINNING, EQUAL-FREQUENCY BINNING, AND ENTROPY-BASED BINNING** WITHOUT RELYING ON BUILT-IN LIBRARIES LIKE `SKLEARN`. THIS REPOSITORY IS DESIGNED FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO **DEEPLY UNDERSTAND AND MANUALLY IMPLEMENT BINNING METHODS** IN DATA PREPROCESSING.

## üéØ WHY BINNING?
BINNING IS A CRUCIAL STEP IN DATA PREPROCESSING FOR:
- **REDUCING NOISE** AND HANDLING OUTLIERS
- **IMPROVING MODEL INTERPRETABILITY**
- **ENHANCING FEATURE ENGINEERING** FOR MACHINE LEARNING

## üî• FEATURES
‚úÖ **EQUAL-WIDTH BINNING** ‚Äì DIVIDES DATA INTO BINS OF EQUAL SIZE  
‚úÖ **EQUAL-FREQUENCY BINNING** ‚Äì ENSURES EACH BIN HAS THE SAME NUMBER OF SAMPLES  
‚úÖ **ENTROPY-BASED BINNING** ‚Äì USES INFORMATION GAIN TO FIND THE BEST SPLIT POINTS  
‚úÖ **MANUAL IMPLEMENTATION** ‚Äì NO BLACK-BOX FUNCTIONS; EVERYTHING IS CALCULATED STEP BY STEP  
‚úÖ **PYTHON CODE EXAMPLES** ‚Äì FULLY FUNCTIONAL IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR LEARNING AND APPLICATION  

## üõ† HOW IT WORKS
EACH BINNING METHOD IS IMPLEMENTED **FROM SCRATCH**, FOLLOWING THESE PRINCIPLES:
1. **EQUAL-WIDTH BINNING**: COMPUTES BIN WIDTH AND ASSIGNS VALUES ACCORDINGLY.
2. **EQUAL-FREQUENCY BINNING**: SORTS VALUES AND ENSURES EACH BIN HAS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SAMPLES.
3. **ENTROPY-BASED BINNING**: FINDS OPTIMAL SPLIT POINTS USING ENTROPY AND INFORMATION GAIN.

## üìù CODE EXAMPLES
HERE‚ÄôS A QUICK LOOK AT HOW **EQUAL-WIDTH BINNING** IS IMPLEMENTED:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def equal_width_binning(data, num_bins):
    bins = np.linspace(min(data), max(data), num_bins + 1)
    labels = [f'BIN {i}' for i in range(1, num_bins + 1)]
    return pd.cut(data, bins=bins, labels=labels, include_lowest=True)

# EXAMPLE USAGE
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
num_bins = 3
binned_data = equal_width_binning(data, num_bins)
print(binned_data)
```

## üìå INSTALLATION & USAGE
